# create-new-revealjs-template
Reveal.js template presentation as a GitHub repo Template
* Includes Reveal.js as a Git submodule so that its commit history is not confused with this presentation's history
* Makes future updating of Reveal.js version very easy
* Reduces the size of the presentation repositories significantly

## Usage
1. Click 'Use This Template'
1. Name your presentation and it will be created in your own GitHub account/org
1. Customise as necessary
1. Push completed slides back to GitHub
1. Configure your GitHub pages settings to serve the slides from _youraccount_.github.io (or custom domain even)
1. **Amaze your friends** by being able to share the URL of your live, interactive slides with your audience immediately. No more emailing PowerPoint attachments for YOU!
